# The database tool from hell

HellDB is a JSON database tool that only psychos would use in production. It is a heavy work-in-progress so feel free to make a PR or issue if you want to help or want something fixed or added.



Usage example:

```js
import { addValue } from "./helldb.js";

addValue("example", 2);
```
